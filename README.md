# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Analysis â€“ Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing loan application data to understand credit risk and develop machine learning models that help financial institutions make informed decisions when approving loans. The goal is to minimize the risk of financial loss due to loan defaults by predicting loan eligibility based on applicant profiles.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict whether a loan should be approved based on various applicant details.
- **Dataset**: A loan application dataset with features such as income, credit history, education, employment status, loan amount, etc.
- **Goal**: Use data analytics and machine learning to reduce the risk of lending money to high-risk customers.

## ðŸ§  Key Tasks Performed

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends and correlations in the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and outliers
  - Applied encoding to categorical variables
- **Model Building**: Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression (Best model â€“ Accuracy: **88.76%**)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Bagging Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - AdaBoost Classifier
- **Model Selection**: Chose the best-performing model using cross-validation and evaluation metrics.


## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and analysis
